# MineSweeper

This project aims to investigate and analyse the Minesweeper game implemented by Mitchell Sayer. The selected Minesweeper code can be found on the following url, GitHub repository.1 Accordingly, we will perform a static analysis and suggest potential code improvements where deemed necessary. The enhancements are done through refactoring the code. By doing so, we aim to address code smells and bugs, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the gameâ€™s performance in terms of time complexity and space complexity.
